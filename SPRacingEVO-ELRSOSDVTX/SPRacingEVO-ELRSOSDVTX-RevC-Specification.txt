SPRacingEVO-ELRSOSDVTX

Can be used stand-alone, stacked with a compatible FC such as the SPRacingH7EVO or mated to optional PDB (e.g. SPRacingEVO-ELRSOSDVTX-PDB) Suitable for use with or without a flight-controller.  Great for high-end builds and FC-less FPV wings/gliders, FPV RC Cars Trucks, etc.
