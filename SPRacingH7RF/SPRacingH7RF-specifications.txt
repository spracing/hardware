Current specs:
Pins Function
4    USB
6    SPI for MPU + FSYNC + INT on TIM4 (with input capture and fsync generation capability)
7    SDIO/SDMMC 4bit + SD detect
10   OctoSPI for code flash
4    2xI2C (I2C2 for internal Baro connection, I2C1 for external use as pins have CAN and TIM16/17 too)
7    SPI for RF + TIM8 with 3 channels (BUSY+2 DIOs)
8    2x 4 channel timers for DSHOT (8 motors)
1    LedStrip (N channel timer)
10   COMP + DAC + 3 timers + 4 GPIOS + 2 ADCs for OSD
1    BIND button
2    2x Status LEDs
1    EXTI for BARO
4    4x ADCs for current1/current2/voltage1/voltage2
1    BEEP Output
1    VTX_PIT
9    5 UARTS (1 USART is TX only, for bi-directional protocols like the VTX or ESC Telemetry, UART4 is CAN capable)

2    RCC32 (Low Speed Oscilator) input.  Not used, but could use unused TIM17 to use GPIOC ODR via DMA as all pins on GPIOC are AF or ANALOG.

PC0/PC1 are 5v tolerant ADC inputs.  Use for current monitoring so that short over-current conditions are handled (i.e. current sensor A/mV is over 3.3v.)

PC2/PC3 for Battery and Regulator voltages.  Analog RSSI not needed as the system has RF built-in with digital connection to RF chip.

ADC2 unused.

PC4/PC5 for OSD - One connection to video in, one connection after the video filter.
