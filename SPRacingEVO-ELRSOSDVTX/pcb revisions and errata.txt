# RevA

## Required hacks

* See latest 'with-hacks' schematic, trace cutting and bodge wires required.

## Errata

* OSD Debug pad silk screen is wrong (G/O/N/D/C, but should be O/G/N/D/C).
* 3D model of SX1280 files has wrong pin-1 orientation.  Silkscreen is OK.
* 6 pins on the ESP32 that were used, cannot be used! Design is incorrect and unusable.
* VTX bias non-functional with ELRS code (it's inverted) software hacks were tested, but it seems the DAC output should be used to drive a FET.
* ELRS RX/TX swapped on the mezzanine connector, swapped on the PCB edge pads, silk incorrect.
* OSD RX/TX OK on the mezzanine connector, swapped on the PCB edge pads, silk incorrect.

## Changes

* N/A Initial revision.

# Rev B

## Required hacks

* Fit 10k resistor on top of C65 so that the VTX PA is not enabled in ESP32 DL mode.

## Errata

* Missing inline inductor on clock signal, see ESP32-S3 hardware design guidelines - "2.4.1
External Clock Source"
* Unstable clock (xtal used was ECS-400-10-37B2-CKM-TR (10pF load) an 2x external 10pF caps)
  load caps should have been 20pF each (min) using formula "CL = (C1 * C2) / (C1 + C2) + Cstray"
* Missing pull-down on VTX-PA EN line, VTX should be disabled in ESP32 download mode and when configuring unified target.
* ELRS RX/TX signals seem to be swapped somehow, need to re-check ESP32S3 pinout.  The RX/TX wires have to be swapped on the jig when going from a RevA board to a RevB board.
* Button doesn't reliable make the ESP32PicoD4 (RevA) or ESP32S3 (RevB) enter boot/download mode, button has good continuity/switching behaviour when tested unpowered.
* Missing GND connection on Pin 5 on both SX1280's, this was to do the GND on the reference schematic also not being connected, which is likely an error.

* Massive (500mV!) voltage sag on 5V rail when ELRS sends telemetry. 1:2 ratio and 100mW TLM power really bad.
  Camera input voltage averages around 4.5V which is enough to cause 5V camera not to power up.
  Sag causes banding on the transmitted video signal (anywhere it's measured, before or after the filter).
  Sag lessened when using 10uF input caps on 2G4 PAs.
  Increasing PA VDD input cap from 1uF to 10uF makes a huge difference.
  Using direct-soldered cables makes a big difference, though PA input caps make bigger difference.
  Doubling 3V3 input cap and output cap and doubling 3V3_BEC input cap to 20uF each makes no difference.
  Adding a 10uF cap to the analog switch supply made no difference.
  Changing the video filter supply from 4.7uF to 10uF cap makes no difference.
  Removing the L4 or adding input caps makes no difference.
  Connecting screen via cable and 30dB attenuator results in no interference, indicating the issue is radiated interference.
  - the OSD never looses sync.
  - the video signal, taken directly from the board at the output of the video filter, and fed to the video in on a monitor, is perfect.
  - Rev A also had a little banding, but no noticable RF interference.

## Changes from Rev A

* Fixed OSD Debug pad silk screen.
* Replaced MCU with ESP32S3
* Used FET for VTX bias circuit, ESP32S3 does not have a DAC.
* RF_NRESET from RevA split into RF_NRESET_1 and RF_NRESET_2 after it was found they need to be isolated.
* RC network added to both RF_NRESET_1 and RF_NRESET_2.
* Used different TCXO and added 1.8V LDO and bypass cap to improve TCXO compatibility (SMD2016 size)
* Moved some resistors and caps by the camera connector inwards a little for better clearance.
* Move Wifi antenna connector inwards a little for more clearance with EVO FCs.

# Rev C

## Errata

* ELRS RX/TX - swapped on the mezzanine connector, OK on the PCB edge pads, silk OK.
* OSD RX/TX  - OK on the mezzanine connector, swapped on the PCB edge pads, silk incorrect.

## Changes from Rev B

* Added LDO for OSD MCU.
* Moved OSD MCU to it's own 3V3 supply from the LDO.
* Used 1.5pF + 10pF caps for 40Mhz XTAL. C9/C8.
* Added pull-down on VTX_PA_EN so it doesn't float in ESP32 download mode.
* Added 2nd inductor on 2nd SX1280, routing the DCC_FB from between them is problematic.
* Use 2x 10uF input caps on each 2G4 PA, should help with power delivery to the PAs.
* 160khz low-pass filter in front of 2G4 PA VDD to smooth out step change when PA's are enabled/disabled.  70kHz half-wave measured.
* Swapped CAM OSD CONTROL/LED_STRIP to move the CAM_OSD_CONTROL off the strapping pin GPIO46 to hopefully make entering download mode via the button
  more reliable.
* GND under all RF traces.
* No RF trace vias.
* RF traces connect to GND on same layer.
* GND under RF traces conncted to GND on layer above.
* Fixed (missing) GND on SX1280's on Pin 5 (not shown in typical application schematic, but DS doesn't say NOT to connect it when using TCXO)
* Use ESP32S3PICO now it's available. Remove XO, which was problematic anyway.
* Pay attention to power routing on 2G4 PAs to avoid ground bounce, follow guidelines in PA datasheet closely.
* Connected SPI on L4 to Flash.
* Minimum two vias for every power trace (MCU + VTX + SX1280 + PAs)
* Stencil could be thinner and/or amount of paste on thermal pad on the S3 could be reduced so that the the S3 seating plane is lower. (50% on RevB, 40% on RevC)
* Added 100nF cap over boot switch between GPIO0 and GND.

## TODO

* N/A

## Maybe

* Use different 3V3 regs with better transient response? (no, have too much stock, improve power routing and RF instead).
* Maybe move the OSD and the video filter VDD to VTX supply (and remove the OSD MCU LDO, no keep new LDO)?
* Maybe use 2450LP14A100T for RF PA's? (No.  Reworked RF instead).
* Investigate intermittent boot switch on ESP, switch is OK but ESP32 isn't always happy with the signal and frequently ignores button presses. (Added 100nF cap over switch.)
* Maybe add pull-up on VTX_SPILE? (No, issue was 25 bit SPI issue on ESP32)
* Add more lead-out to the ESP32-S3 pads so rework is easier? (No, no issues with the S3 soldering after all)
* Maybe add 10k pull-down on BOOT0 on STM32L4 to avoid having to set nBOOT0 in option bytes.
  - Currently the BOOT0 pin *CAN* be used a GPIO/debugging pad.
  - No, no need, no space.

### If using non-pico S3

* Add inline inductor on clock signal , see ESP32-S3 hardware design guidelines - "2.4.1
External Clock Source"
* Try and avoid routing signals under 40Mhz XTAL.

# Rev D

## Changes from Rev C

* ELRS RX/TX swapped on the mezzanine connector. Pads OK, Mezzanine OK, Silk OK.
* OSD RX/TX swapped on the PCB edge pads.  Pads OK, Mezzanine OK, Silk OK

## TODO

* N/A

## Maybe

* Remove Cap over ESP32S3 boot switch.
