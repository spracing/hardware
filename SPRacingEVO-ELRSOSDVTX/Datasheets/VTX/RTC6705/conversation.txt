Hi Dominic,

Confirmed. Both pin 12 & 18 are not connected with bonding wires. We use these pins for routing 3.3V power in a 2-layer PCB Reference design. That is the reason.

Regards,

Henry

Hi Henry,

Next question:
10. Can you confirm pins 12 and pins 18 are Not Internally Connected and can be left un-connected, the reference schematics have them connected to +3v3.  See attached.  If they are NC then why are they connected to 3v3 on the reference designs?

Many thanks,

Dominic Clifton


Hi Dominic,

RTC6705- $1.2/ unit , 3000pcs/ per reel, 4 weeks lead time, we have 6705 in stock now.

Regards,
Terry.

Hi Dominic,

1. Yes. You can disconnect these pins for video only application. Please see attached NA_5G_6705+6659E(3X3)s-SCH.pdf 2. Please see attached Mono Audio (MA) application circuits.
3. Those are damping filters to attenuate the video signal from DVD player (e.g. 1Vpp).
4. We don't know the side effect of removing these filters for your video signal.
5. C21 is for DC blocking. The resistor divider here set the DC level for input stage and try to keep the video input as linear as possible.
6. These resistors are ESD protection when an external DIP switch is used to select the channel. You can remove it if connected to MCU.
7. See attached.
8. No replacement for RTC6705. RTC6659 is EOL. You can use RTC6670P, or RTC5636H which will EOL this year. 
9. @Terry, lead time and pricing please.

Regards,

Henry

Subject: RTC6705

Hi everyone,

It's been a while since I contacted you regarding the RTC6705, I ended up doing a different product in the end.  However I'm now ready to make a VTX using the RTC6705 again and have a couple of questions now that my schematic is in-progress.

1. If I don't want to use ANY audio, can I leave the following pins disconnected?  If not what should I do.
RF_VT2, VDD_6.0, AVT1, ACP1, AOUT1, VDD_6.5, AOUT2, ACP2, AVT2.
2. If I want to use a MONO input, what components from the reference design can be omitted, which of the 6.0 or 6.5 circuits should be used, should any pins be bridged?
3. It seems there is some filter made by C5/C4/L1/C7, C16/C15/L2/C3, R6/C17/R7/R15, please can you give me the requirements/specifications of the filters and the purpose of each one.
4. Can a video signal conditioner be used instead of some of the filters, my design already uses an FMS6141 (Single-Channel 4 th Order Standard Definition Video Filter Driver).
5. Please can you tell me the purpose of C21/R13 and the voltage divider at R21/R14.
6. Are R11/R17/R8/R16/R5 simply current limiting resistors?  I intend to connect the RTC6705 to an ESP32-Pico-D4 and I'm wondering if they can be omitted without issues.
7. Do you have any updated technical documentation for the RTC6705.
8. Are there any replacement/new parts for either the RTC6705 or the RTC6659 PA.
9. May I also enquire as to factory lead-times for the RTC6705, RTC6659 and current pricing?

Many thanks!
